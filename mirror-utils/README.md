# MacPorts mirror utilities #

## fetch-mirror-sites ##

Fetch a list of mirrors, extract the URLs of FTP and HTTP(S) mirrors,
and print them to standard output in a format suitable for
[`mirror_sites.tcl`][mirror_sites].

    fetch-mirror-sites [-a] [-K <curl config>] [--] <source>

*   `-a`: Output all URLs. By default, we "deduplicate" by outputting
    only one URL per [fully qualified domain name][fqdn], prioritizing
    HTTPS over HTTP over FTP. (This is a na√Øve attempt to avoid trying
    a single host multiple times, once per available protocol. URLs
    referring to the same host by different FQDNs must be culled
    manually.)

*   `-K`: Specify the path to a `curl(1)` config file to use when
    fetching the source (or `-` to read a config from standard input).
    The argument is passed directly to `curl --config`, so refer to the
    [`curl(1)` documentation][curl] for details.

*   `<source>`: The name of a supported mirror list.
