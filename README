== What is this? ==

This directory contains projects which are related to MacPorts. But they are
not being shipped with the base code itself, instead you are supposed to check
them out from Subversion and build them yourself. Some of them are also
available as ports in the tree or are used as a base to create multiple ports.

mpwa
    MacPorts Web Application

    This will become a web application to access and manipulate ports.

mpab
    MacPorts Auto Build

    This is an attempt to write an build server for MacPorts which tests ports
    automatically.

select
    select tool

    This is used as a base for the ports gcc_select and python_select. It
    creates symlinks to switch between multiple versions of the same software.

MacPorts_Framework
    MacPorts.Framework

    This is an Objective-C Framework wrapper for the MacPorts Tcl API. 


== Support ==
