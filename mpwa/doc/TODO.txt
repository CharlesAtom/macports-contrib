Needed Schema Changes:

Potentials:

  - Additional Search options:
    - Portname vs. partial portname? (Currently searches partial portname).
    - Search port descriptions in addition to port names.
  - Make latest/greatest port version more visible


User Authentication/Registration:

  - Existing users may request validation by clicking a "validateme" link,
    which will send them an email with a special token allowing them to
    enter identifying information, etc.
    
  - New users request registration in much the same way: by entering their
    email address (which creates a record for them) and responding to the
    validation email.
    
  - Any user must pass some sort of captcha test in addition to entering
    a pass phrase to be able to login and complete registration.
    
  - User profile includes their public key, email address, login name,
    and first and last name
